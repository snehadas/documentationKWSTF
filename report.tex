\title{Water Service platform for underserviced communities}
\author{Chang Liu, Sneha Das}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This report presents the prototyping of an application addressing the ’crowd-
sourcing’ of the inspection and detection of water service malfunctions, in under-
resourced communities. The application has options for civilians, who wish to
report malfunctions and leakages, and plumbers to register with the KWSTF,
to provide timely services to repairs, based on standard remuneration. Thus,
this application is conceptualized to function as a mediator between the public,
who thrive to maintain the water services for the community, and the plumbers
available in the region. Not only does this accelerate the provision of services
for maintaining water infrastructure when resources are constrained, but also
helps in providing jobs and visibility to the plumbing community.

The applica-
tion begins with \lipsum[2]

\section{Background}
In the design of the UI, we have explored the following guidelines:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\bf Four Principles of Good Design (Shneiderman 1998)}
\begin{itemize}
\item State and the action alternatives should be visible
\item Should be a good conceptual model with a consistent system image
\item Interface should include good mappings that reveal the relationships between stages
\item User should receive continuous feedback
\end{itemize}

\item{\bf Nielsen’s Ten Heuristic Rules (1993)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple and natural dialog
\item Speak the user’s language
\item Minimize user’s memory load
\item Consistency
\item Feedback
\item Clearly marked exits
\item Shortcuts
\item Good error messages
\item Prevent errors
\item Help and documentation
\end{itemize}
\item{\bf Jakob Nielsen’s Ten Usability Heuristics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Visibility of system status (Feedback)
  \item Match between system and the real world (METAPHOR)
  \item User control and freedom (NAVIGATION)
  \item Consistency and standards (CONSISTENCY)
  \item Error prevention (PREVENTION)
  \item Recognition rather than recall (MEMORY)
  \item Flexibility and efficiency of use (EFFICIENCY)
  \item Aesthetic and minimalist design (DESIGN)
  \item Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (RECOVERY)
  \item Help and documentation (Help)
\end{itemize}
\item{\bf Shneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item Strive for consistency
\item Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
\item Offer informative feedback
\item Design dialog to yield closure
\item Offer simple error handling
\item Permit easy reversal of actions
\item Support internal locus of control
\item Reduce short-term memory load
\end{itemize}
\item{\bf Smith \& Mosier: Data Display}
\begin{itemize}
\item 2.0/1Necessary Data Displayed
\item 2.0/2 Only Necessary Data Displayed
\item 2.0/3 Data Displayed in Usable Form
\item 2.0/4 Data Display Consistent with User Conventions2.0/6 Consistent Display Format
\item 2.0/8 User Control of Data Display
\item 2.0/12 Familiar Wording
\item 2.0/15 Consistent Grammatical Structure
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}
The tools we are using includes design tools and software engineering tools.
For the design tools, we used paper and hand drawing to draw the framework of the initial pages, and then we organize
the initial pages together to a flow diagram, with a clear indication of how the pages are interacting with each other.
For the engineering tools, we used Android Studio to put the design we made into an android project. We used xml
language to define the layout of the page and then we used java language to create the function behind the layout.

Implementation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Popup-window
\item Time-track and Estimated Time Notice
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

When the user want to report a leak and right after the user hit the “Send Report” button, a pop-up window will be
activated and displayed on “My Report” page, give the user positive respond that the report has been sent. At the same
time, the timer was sent to track the time that has passed since the user submitted the case, so the user could have a clear
image that how fast the KWSTF are responding to the report.
After KWSTF has found a plumber, “My Report” will be updated, a “Count-down” timer will be activated according to the
time the plumber estimated to spend on fixing the leak, so the user could be clear that the leak will be fixed in a specific
time. At the same time, the previous timer will stop counting and display the time used to find a plumber.

\section{Results}

\section{discussion}
After the plumber has submitted the registrations form, the user will be sent to “My Profile”, with a notification on the title saying
the profile has been sent to KWSTF, the estimated time for the process will be displayed under the title, so the user would be clear
when he could get the respond from KWSFT, besides that, the contact information are displayed under, the user could choose to
call or send an email to inquire about his case.
When a decision is made by KWSTF, “My Profile” page will be updated, with “Approved” or “Pending” or “Rejected” status
displayed under, if it’s still in “Pending”, KWSTF contact info are available on the page for user to take the next step.
